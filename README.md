The problem at hand is to classify tweets related to the Corona Virus into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral, using machine learning algorithms. Two popular algorithms for classification are logistic regression and Naive Bayes, and the performance of each algorithm will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and auc-roc score
To preprocess the text data, CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer can be used to convert the tweets into a numeric format that can be easily used for training the classification models. CountVectorizer counts the frequency of each word in a document, while TF-IDF Vectorizer considers the frequency of the word across all documents.
By applying these vectorization techniques to preprocess the tweets, the text data can be converted into a numeric format that can be easily used for training the classification models. The performance of each algorithm using these vectorization techniques will be evaluated to determine which algorithm and vectorization technique works best for classifying Corona Virus Tweet Sentiments.
